A simple song recommendation system based on a user's Spotify playlists used to demonstrate the k-means clustering algorithm. The Spotify API is used to get songs' characteristics like danceability, energy and acousticness as well as allow users to import playlists. The website uses the user's playlist to match songs to a stock set of songs with a wide range of characteristics. It then recommends songs from the cluster that has the maximum number of songs from user's playlist.
